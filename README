1) main.ts is core part of obsidian plugin. I can go and install hello-world obisidan plugin for a lot of stuff, then replace 'main.ts'. It will create command 'Ctrl+P' 'zuza editor'
2) It all requires special setup of files
3) It will launch 'start.sh' script
4) You will put number of code example
5) It will copy files to specil directory
